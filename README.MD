# Introduction to Flask and Flask-RESTful

# steps to Install and run Hello World Flask App
- Install Flask By running the command `pip install Flask`
- Create a file called `app.py`

# Creating A database using Flask SQLAlchemy

- for creating a database using Flask SQLAlchemy we need to install SQLAlchemy by running the command `pip install SQLAlchemy`
- SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- SQLAlchemy provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.
- SQLAlchemy provides a generalized interface for creating and executing database-agnostic code without needing to write SQL statements.
- SQLAlchemy provides a core level of service, independent of the database engine used, which can be extended through the use of optional components such as ORM and database schema definition.

# On Linux 
- If you are unable to create a database using python shell it shows error sometimes 
- Use flask Shell and create a database  (db.create_all())
- 

# Flask-RESTful

- Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.
- Flask-RESTful encourages best practices with minimal setup. If you are familiar with Flask, Flask-RESTful should be easy to pick up. It provides a coherent collection of decorators and tools to describe your API and expose its documentation properly (using Swagger).
- Flask-RESTful provides the flexibility of using different HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, etc. to perform different actions.
- Flask-RESTful also provides support for custom request data such as JSON, XML, YAML, etc. because of its built-in request parsing.
- Flask-RESTful also provides support for custom response data such as JSON, XML, YAML, etc. because of its built-in response formatting.
- Flask-RESTful also provides support for custom error handling.
- Flask-RESTful also provides support for custom authentication and authorization.
- Flask-RESTful also provides support for custom URL routing.

# install Jinja2 for Flask Templates
- Jinja2 is a template engine for Python. It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.
- Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django’s templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools.
- Jinja2 is a full-featured template engine for Python. It has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment, widely used and BSD licensed.
- Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. It is fast, widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment.
- Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment.
